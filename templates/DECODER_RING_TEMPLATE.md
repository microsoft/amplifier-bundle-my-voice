# [USER_NAME] Decoder Ring

**Purpose:** Guide for Amplifier instances helping recipients parse [USER_NAME]'s communications.

**Usage:** When your human receives a message from [USER_NAME], use this to extract what THEY need, transformed for how THEY consume information.

---

## What You're Dealing With

[USER_NAME]'s communications have these characteristics:

### The Pattern
```
[Describe their typical message structure]
Example: [Quick opener] → [Context] → [Point] → [More context] → [Ask]
```

### Why It's Like This
- [Root causes of their communication style]
- [What drives their verbosity or terseness]
- [What they're optimizing for]

### The Good News
[What's valuable in their communications despite the challenges]

## Extraction Framework

### Step 1: Find the Structural Anchors

[USER_NAME] signals structure with:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "[phrase]" | [what it indicates] |

### Step 2: Identify the Core Elements

Every [USER_NAME] communication usually contains:

1. **The Context** ([X]% of the message typically)
   - [What kind of context they provide]

2. **The Point** (often [where])
   - [How to find it]

3. **The Ask** (often [where])
   - [How to identify it]

4. **The Tangents** (interspersed)
   - [How to recognize and handle them]

### Step 3: Assess Recipient Needs

Before transforming, consider what YOUR human needs:

| Recipient Type | Focus On | De-emphasize |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| **Executive** | [what] | [what] |
| **Technical peer** | [what] | [what] |
| **Direct report** | [what] | [what] |
| **External partner** | [what] | [what] |

## Transformation Guidelines

### For Executives
- [How to transform for this audience]
- [Target length/format]

### For Technical Peers
- [How to transform for this audience]
- [What to preserve]

### For Direct Reports
- [How to transform for this audience]
- [What to clarify]

### For General Audiences
- [How to transform for this audience]
- [What to translate]

## Common Patterns to Decode

### [Pattern Name]
```
Original: [Example of the pattern]

Decoded: [How to transform it]
```

### [Pattern Name]
```
Original: [Example]

Decoded: [Transformation]
```

---

## Preservation Rules

Even when transforming heavily, preserve:

1. [What must always be kept]
2. [What carries important meaning]
3. [What would be lost if removed]

---

## Red Flags in Decoding

Watch for these - they signal "don't over-simplify here":

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| [signal] | [why it matters] |

---

## Example Transformation

### [USER_NAME]'s Original (abbreviated):
> [Example of their typical communication]

### Decoded for [Audience Type]:
> [Transformed version]

### Decoded for [Different Audience]:
> [Different transformation]

## Continuous Improvement

This decoder ring should evolve. When you successfully decode a [USER_NAME] communication:

1. Note patterns that worked
2. Flag any new signals/structures discovered
3. Track what transformations worked for which recipient types
